# Curvetopia-Adobe-2024

Welcome to **Curvetopia-Adobe**, a project dedicated to bringing order and beauty to the world of 2D curves! This repository is a journey into identifying, regularizing, and beautifying various types of curves in 2D Euclidean space, with a focus on closed curves, symmetry, and curve completion techniques.

## Objective
The mission of Curvetopia-Adobe is to develop a comprehensive process for identifying,regularizing, and beautifying curves, starting with simple shapes and progressing to more complex forms. The project is designed to work with curves represented by cubic Bézier curves and polylines, with outputs visualized in SVG format.

## Features

### Curve Regularization
Identify and classify regular shapes from a given set of curves:
- **Straight Lines**: Detect and classify straight lines within the curve data.
- **Circles and Ellipses**: Identify circular shapes where all points are equidistant from a center or ellipses with two focal points.
- **Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles**: Distinguish between sharp-edged and rounded rectangles.
- **Regular Polygons**: Detect polygons with equal sides and angles.
- **Star Shapes**: Identify star-shaped curves with a central point and radial arms.

### Symmetry Exploration in Curves
Focus on closed shapes to uncover various types of symmetry, including reflection symmetry. The project seeks to convert curves into point sets and fit Bézier curves to points that demonstrate symmetrical properties.

### Partial Curves
Develop algorithms to seamlessly complete 2D curves that have gaps due to occlusion. The project investigates different levels of shape occlusion:
## Evaluation
Regularization and symmetry are evaluated based on the number of regular geometric shapes and symmetry detected.To ensure accurate curve completion, rasterization techniques are applied to handle occlusion.
